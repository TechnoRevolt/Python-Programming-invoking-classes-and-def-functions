  <p> We are gearing towards the unprecedented technological advances in the field of information technology which depicts the current decade as the new Industrial Revolution but with the extensive and intensive application of computers for automating everything from laundry to buying basic necessities.There is no doubt, the next decade's economy and the society itself will evolve according to the computer technology that will be introduced during that epoch.Most recently, technological advances are propelling rapidly which are fueled by new disoveries and programming laguages that some societies across the globe cound keep pace with. While 3 - D has been here with us for quite some time yet it remains in the domain  of the artists and hobbyists. Not only that they are so slow and indeed are so expensive.Just 2 years ago, a Boston-area startup, Desktop Metal, began to ship its first metal prototyping machines in December . It plans to begin selling larger machines, designed for manufacturing, that are 100 times faster than older metal printing methods.<br><br>
    AI (Artificial Intelligence) had been the biggest talk in magazines,tabloids , mass media outlets and among the others but it was so expensive and concentrated on the hands of the few elites.However, the technological boom created huge data that a group of human beings can not handle such huge data posted on the internet.Big Tech Companies found a solution, machine-learning tools based in the cloud are bringing AI to a far broader audience. So far, Amazon dominates cloud AI with its AWS subsidiary. Google is challenging that with TensorFlow, an open-source AI library that can be used to build other machine-learning software. Recently Google announced Cloud AutoML, a suite of pre-trained systems that could make AI simpler to use.
With the advent of these advances, this Home Page caters the needs of the would be programmers who are will to learn the most basic programming skills to the most complex.So wthout further ado, let us begin learning from scratch towards the best.

  <p>
    A)PYTHON FUNCTION<br><br>
Function in Python is defined by a def statement.It consists related statements that perform multiple tasks.It breaks a program into smaller chunks , as a program grows larger; it helps organize it to be readable and reusable.<br><br>
1)Accessing the body within the function.<br><br>
def revolution():<br>
    print('The revolution in Russia on 1917 was the greatest human upheaval that toppled down the Monarchy.')<br><br>

revolution()<br>
The revolution in Russia on 1917 was the greatest human upheaval that toppled down the Monarchy.<br><br>
Anatomy of a function.<br>
def is the statement.<br>
revolution is the name of the function.<br>
()The parameter list.<br>
Print('')The body of the function.<br><br><br>

2)Using the the return keyword.<br><br>
def revolution():<br>
    return('The revolution in Russia on 1917 was the greatest human upheaval that toppled down the Monarchy.')<br><br>

print(revolution())<br>
The revolution in Russia on 1917 was the greatest human upheaval that toppled down the Monarchy.<br><br><br>

3)Placing a data within the parameter list.<br><br>
def revolution(revolutionaries):<br>
    print(revolutionaries + 'the revolution in Russia on 1917 was the greatest human upheaval that toppled down the Monarchy.')<br><br>

revolution('The marxists led ')<br>
The marxists led the revolution in Russia on 1917 was the greatest human upheaval that toppled down the Monarchy.<br><br>
The revolution is the name of the function with the revolutionaries as the argument or parameter.'The marxists led' is a statement which corresponds with the revolutionaries.<br><br><br>

4)Loading multiple data inside the parameter list.<br><br>
def hello(name, age):<br>
    print('Hi ' + name + ' I am glad to meet you ' + age + ' and being with that age means agility and versatility.')<br><br>

hello(' Gabrielle,',str(20))<br>
Hi  Gabrielle, I am glad to meet you 20 and being with that age means agility and versatility.<br><br>
Notice that the word str is prefixed before the 20 to convert it into a string otherwise Python will render an error message.The other way to convert it into a string by simply closing it with singe quotation marks like '20'.<br><br><br>

5)Working with numerical values and using mathematical operations for calculation.<br><br>
def add(a, b):<br>
    return a + b<br><br>

a = add(10,10)<br>
print(a)<br>
20<br><br>
using a variable is necessary to show the result of the sum of the 2 numbers.Changing the mathematical operators in the return statement like -, * or / will change the result according to the operator being used.<br><br><br>

6)Another method of storing data and manipulating the print statement.<br><br>
def hoax(amount,name):<br><br>
    print(amount + ' was robbed from the taxes of the people.')<br>
    print('Ferdinand Marcos' + name)<br><br>

hoax('Billions of dollars',' was the greatest thief in the history of mankind.')<br><br>

Billions of dollars was robbed from the taxes of the people.<br>
Ferdinand Marcos was the greatest thief in the history of mankind.<br><br><br>

7)Another method of storing data within the parameter list.<br><br>
def add (a = 5,b = 5):<br>
    return a + b<br><br>

a = add()<br>
print(a)<br><br>

10<br><br><br>

8)Using if , elif and else statetemnt in a body.<br><br>
def add(a, b):<br>
    if a == 10:<br>
        return a + b<br><br>

    elif b == 10:<br>
        return a + b<br><br>

    else:<br>
        print('Look for another lady.')<br><br>

a = add(10,10)<br>
print(a)<br><br>

a = add(5,5)<br>

20<br><br>
Look for another number.<br><br><br>

9)Creating multiple def functions.<br><br>
def cat(age,name):<br><br>

    return age + name<br><br>

a = cat('Pillow my cat is 5 years old. ','She is too old to snatch Jim to be her husband.')<br>
print(a)<br><br>

def Imee(snatcher):<br>
    print('But I knew a woman named Imee, she snatched a man to be his husband.' + snatcher)<br>
Imee('She is very sick!')<br><br>


Pillow my cat is 5 years old. She is too old to snatch Jim to be her husband.<br>
But I knew a woman named Imee, she snatched a man to be his husband.She is very sick!<br><br><br>

10)Creating a program to calculate the original price added with VAT(Value Added Tax) and inflation rate.<br><br>
First create a discriptive list with multiple variables that every value corresponds with each item within the list.<br>
price, vat, inflation = [1000, .012, .006]<br><br>

#To obtain the price added with vat, multiply the price with the vat then add the result with it.<br><br>

def result():<br>
    return price * vat<br><br>

rate = result()<br>
print (str(rate) + ' is the value that should be added from the original price.')<br><br>

#It is not necessary to store data within the parameter list since the arguments are stroed in the multiple variables that was established.<br><br>
#the output of the program is:<br>
#12.0 is the value that should be added from the original price.<br><br>

#Since the product from the price and vat has been determined and so it should be added to the original price to present the new price.<br><br>

def new_price():<br>
    return price + rate<br><br>

valued_price = new_price()<br>
print(str(valued_price) + ' is the new price added injected with the pocket-tearing  the value added tax.')<br><br>

#But the price is not yet final to be paid at the market's cashier since inflation rate must also be calculated.<br><br>

def inflated_price():<br>
    return valued_price * inflation<br><br>

bloated_price = inflated_price()<br>
print(str(bloated_price) + ' is another additional payment that tears the wallet to pieces.')<br><br>

def final_price():<br>
    return valued_price + bloated_price<br><br>

a = final_price()<br>
print(str(a) + " is the over all payment that should be paind in the market's cashier.")<br><br>

12.0 is the value that should be added from the original price.<br>
1012.0 is the new price added injected with the pocket-tearing  the value added tax.<br>
6.072 is another additional payment that tears the wallet to pieces.<br>
1018.072 is the over all payment that should be paind in the market's cashier.<br><br><br>

B)PYTHON CLASSES<br><br>
A Class in python is an object constructor<br><br>

1)Accessing the data in a class.<br>
class Sample:<br>
    x = 5<br><br>

a = Sample()<br>
print(a.x)<br>
The outcome is 5<br><br><br>

2)Storing string in variables in a class.<br><br>
class Dinosaurs:<br>
    a = 'T-rex is the most powerful among the reptiles.'<br>
    b = 'Duterte is the father of all the reptile - eating reptiles.'<br><br>

Digong = Dinosaurs<br><br>
print(Digong.a)<br>
print(Digong.b)<br><br>

T-rex is the most powerful among the reptiles.<br>
Duterte is the father of all the reptile - eating reptiles.<br><br><br>

3)Using the prin function in parentheses.<br><br>
class AncientCivilization:<br>
    print('Iraq used to be the cradle of the ancient civilization.')<br><br>

AncientCivilization()<br>
Iraq used to be the cradle of the ancient civilization.<br><br><br>

4)Class inheritors.<br><br>
class Ancient:<br>
    print('We evolved from our glorious past.')<br><br>

class Persia(Ancient):<br>
    print('One of the greatest ancient civilizations that we owed our education.')<br><br>

class Mesopotamia(Ancient):<br>
    print('Considered to be the cradle of civilization that spread all through out the European continent.')<br><br>

Ancient()<br><br>

We evolved from our glorious past.<br>
One of the greatest ancient civilizations that we owed our education.<br>
Considered to be the cradle of civilization that spread all through out the European continent.<br><br><br>
5)Converting string into a list with multiple strings.<br><br>
class Split:<br>
        b = 'Peter tumbles down with a pail of water.'<br>
        b.split()<br><br>

a = Split()<br>
print(a.b.split())<br><br>

['Peter', 'tumbles', 'down', 'with', 'a', 'pail', 'of', 'water.']<br><br>

6) OR<br><br>
class Split:<br>
        b = 'Peter tumbles down with a pail of water.'<br>
        c = b.split()<br><br>

a = Split()<br>
print(a.c)<br><br>

['Peter', 'tumbles', 'down', 'with', 'a', 'pail', 'of', 'water.']<br><br><br>

7)counting the numbers of strings within the list.<br><br>
class Split:<br><br>
        b = 'Peter tumbles down with a pail of water.'<br>
        c = b.split()<br>
        d = len(c)<br><br>
a = Split()<br>
print(a.c)<br>
print(a.d)<br><br>

['Peter', 'tumbles', 'down', 'with', 'a', 'pail', 'of', 'water.']<br>
8<br><br><br>

8)Complex Python Programming.<br><br>

C)DEF AND CLASSES COMBINED<br><br>
1)Grabbing the information in a class method and def function.<br><br>
class Fishes:<br>
    def Tuna(self):<br>
        print('They are deep sea divers and live in deeper oceans for existence.')<br><br>

a = Fishes()<br>
a.Tuna()<br><br>


They are deep sea divers and live in deeper oceans for existence.<br><br><br>

2)Class inheritance or inheritors.<br><br>
class Fishes:<br>
    def habitat(self):<br>
        print('Some of the fishes live in lakes, oceans or rivers.')<br><br>

class Tuna(Fishes):<br>
    def specie(self):<br>
        print('The Tuna population is dwindling due to pollution and overfishing.')<br><br>

class Tilapia(Fishes):<br>
    def life(self):<br>
        print('A tilapia can grow bigger if placed in a pond.')<br><br>

a = Fishes()<br>
a.habitat()<br><br>

b = Tuna()<br>
b.specie()<br><br>

c = Tilapia()<br>
c.life()<br><br>

Some of the fishes live in lakes, oceans or rivers.<br>
The Tuna population is dwindling due to pollution and overfishing.<br>
A tilapia can grow bigger if placed in a pond.<br><br><br>

3)Another method of accessing the information within classes.<br><br>
class Fishes:<br>
    def specie(self):<br>
        print("Tuna's population dwindles due to overfishing.")<br>
        print('Water pollution also hinders the growth of its population.')<br><br>

class Sharks(Fishes):<br>
    def life(self):<br>
        print('Sharks usually live in deeper oceans.')<br><br>


a = Sharks()<br>
a.life()<br>
a.specie()<br><br>
Sharks usually live in deeper oceans.<br>
Tuna's population dwindles due to overfishing.<br>
Water pollution also hinders the growth of its population.<br><br><br>

        self.who = who<br>
        self.crimes = crimes<br>
        self.diseases = diseases<br><br>

a = Anaconda('They are Called Filipino Politicians.','They murdered poor Filipinos through hunger.','Their corruption is contagious and the deadliest virus.')<br>
print(a.who,a.crimes,a.diseases)<br><br>

They are Called Filipino Politicians. They murdered poor Filipinos through hunger. Their corruption is contagious and the deadliest virus.<br><br><br>

3)Interchanging data through the dynamism of inheritance.<br><br>
